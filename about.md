I'm Béatrice, an email strategist, [musician](https://www.facebook.com/captlovelace/) and artist based in Brighton, East Sussex (England). 
I'm currently working on [Space for Imagination](https://space-for-imagination.tumblr.com/), a walking workshop and [Flâneurs](https://www.mixcloud.com/flaneurs), a monthly radio show on Resonance Extra. 
I volunteer at Fabrica, a local contemporary art gallery. 
I've also helped promote community and  art initiatives, such as [Diep~Haven](http://www.diephaven.org/)

Goodies: I do wear [running shoes](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running_shoes), speak Norwegian and study user research.
