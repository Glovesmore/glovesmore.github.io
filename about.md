I'm Béatrice, an artist and researcher based in Brighton, East Sussex (England). 
I'm currently working on [Space for Imagination](https://space-for-imagination.tumblr.com/), a walking workshop and [Flâneurs](https://www.mixcloud.com/flaneurs), a monthly radio show on Resonance Extra. 
I volunteer at Fabrica, a local contemporary art gallery.
I also promote community and art initiatives, such as [Diep~Haven](http://www.diephaven.org/). 



Goodies: I do wear [running shoes](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running_shoes), speak Norwegian and iterate a lot.\\
Guilty pleasures: Emails, coffee brewing, [songwriting](https://www.facebook.com/captlovelace/)and old maps.
