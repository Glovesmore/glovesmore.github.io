<p>I volunteer at Fabrica, a local contemporary art gallery.
I also promote community and art initiatives, such as [Diep~Haven](http://www.diephaven.org/).</p>  



<li>Goodies: I do wear [running shoes](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running_shoes), speak Norwegian and iterate a lot with a pair of scissors. 
<li>Guilty pleasures: Emails, coffee brewing, [songwriting](https://www.facebook.com/captlovelace/)and old maps.</li>
